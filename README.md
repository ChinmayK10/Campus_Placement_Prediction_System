# Campus_Placement_Prediction_System
Campus Placement Prediction System is a predictive analytics system that leverages supervised learning models to determine whether a student is likely to be placed in campus recruitment. The project includes robust data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), multiple classification algorithms, and model evaluation. It is designed for scalability and deployment as a backend API or dashboard.

## Key Features
* Predicts placement status (Placed / Not Placed) using real-world student data.
* Implements and compares multiple ML models:
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Achieves ~88% accuracy using ensemble-based methods.
* Performs feature engineering: encoding, correlation filtering, and anomaly handling.
* Visualizes key patterns in placement trends using statistical plots.
